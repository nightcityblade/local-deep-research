"""Deterministic DNS for the Memos provider suite.

The origin policy classifies *resolved* addresses, so without a seam every
configuration built in these tests performs a live lookup. That is slow
(hundreds of negative lookups per run) and, worse, wrong on any CI resolver
that answers NXDOMAIN with a fixed address -
``dnsmasq --address=/#/127.0.0.1`` and several corporate resolvers do -
which would classify ``memos.example.com`` as loopback and fail roughly
thirty tests.

Hosts under ``.invalid`` are stubbed as unresolvable; everything else
resolves to a single TEST-NET-3 address. Individual tests still override the
stub with their own ``monkeypatch.setattr``.
