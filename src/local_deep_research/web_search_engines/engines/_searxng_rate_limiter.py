"""Shared rate limiter for SearXNG engine instances.

The research agent constructs a fresh `SearXNGSearchEngine` for every
tool call, so the previous per-instance `last_request_time` only
throttled requests on engines that were explicitly reused (for example
the shared engine used by `JournalReputationFilter` for Tier 4). This
module provides a process-wide tracker keyed by SearXNG ``instance_url``
so the configured ``delay_between_requests`` actually applies across
per-call engine instances.

The locking pattern mirrors other per-key locks in the codebase
(see ``database/backup/backup_service.py`` and
``database/encrypted_db.py``): a meta-lock guards lazy creation of a
per-URL lock, and that per-URL lock guards updates to the timestamp.

Note on memory:
`_url_locks` and `_url_last_request` are bounded to a maximum capacity
(`MAX_TRACKED_URLS`). When capacity is reached, stale/least-recently-used
entries are evicted under `_meta_lock`. The two maps are always popped
together, and a timestamp is only written while its URL is still tracked
(see ``_record_request_time``), so `_url_last_request` can never outgrow
`_url_locks`. There is deliberately no periodic sweep for orphaned
timestamps: prevention is preferred to cleanup, and with every write
guarded the sweep would be *unnecessary*, not unsafe -- it would in fact
be trivially safe, since the write it would race against now happens
under the same ``_meta_lock`` a sweep would hold.
